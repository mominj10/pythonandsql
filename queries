Change the query shown so that it displays Nobel prizes for 1950.
SELECT yr, subject, winner
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr = 1950


2. Show who won the 1962 prize for literature.
SELECT winner
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr = 1962
   AND subject = 'literature'


3. Show the year and subject that won 'Albert Einstein' his prize.
select yr, subject
from nobel
where winner='Albert Einstein'

4. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
Per Capita GDPThe per capita GDP is the gdp/population

select name from world
where continent='Europe' and gdp/population > 
(select gdp/population from world
where name='United Kingdom');

 5. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

SELECT name, continent 
FROM world 
WHERE continent IN (
    SELECT continent 
    FROM world 
    WHERE name IN ('Argentina', 'Australia')
)
ORDER BY name;

6. Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.

SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')
AND population < (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany');

7. Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
The format should be Name, Percentage for example:

SELECT 
    name,
    CONCAT(ROUND((population / (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany')) * 100), '%') AS population_percentage_of_germany
FROM 
    world
WHERE 
    continent = 'Europe';

8. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

SELECT 
    name
FROM 
    world
WHERE 
    gdp > ALL (SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp IS NOT NULL);

9. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)

10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

SELECT 
    name,
    continent
FROM 
    world x
WHERE 
    population > ALL (
        SELECT 
            3 * population 
        FROM 
            world y 
        WHERE 
            y.continent = x.continent 
            AND y.name != x.name
    );
